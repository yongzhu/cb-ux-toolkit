# NOTE

The code is taken directly from here [the Angular 6.x branch of Material](https://github.com/angular/material2/tree/6.x/src/lib/schematics/utils).

Some modifications were made to fit the library's lint rules and types were changed due to differing versions of dependent packages. This library also has a dev dependency on `@schematics/angular` which pulls in many of the utilities were copied by the Material project.
