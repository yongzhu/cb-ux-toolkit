# NOTE

The code is taken directly from here [the Angular 6.x branch of Material](https://github.com/angular/material2/tree/6.x/src/lib/schematics/utils/devkit-utils).

That code was pulled from the Angular schematics package. The `config.ts` file that is currently in this directory was taken directly from the Material library but I (Mike Gardner) wasn't able to find it in the Angular schematics source. Many of the files that are located in the linked branch of Material are no longer needed to be copied as the `@schematics/angular` package contains them (but does not contain the `getProjectFromWorkspace` function).
